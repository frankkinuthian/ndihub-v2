# Enrollment Status Fix - Post-Payment Button Update

## 🐛 Problem Description

After a student successfully completes payment through IntaSend or Stripe, the EnrollButton doesn't update to show "Access Course". The button remains in the "Enroll Now" state even though the payment was successful and the enrollment was created in the database.

### Root Cause
1. **Server-side rendering**: The `isEnrolled` status is determined at page load time
2. **No client-side refresh**: After payment, the user returns to the same page with stale data
3. **Webhook timing**: The webhook creates enrollment in the background, but the frontend doesn't know about it
4. **Static state**: The EnrollButton component doesn't re-check enrollment status after payment

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### 1. Client-Side Enrollment Status Checking

**Created**: `hooks/useEnrollmentStatus.ts`
- Custom React hook that checks enrollment status on the client side
- Provides `isEnrolled`, `isLoading`, `error`, and `refetch` functionality
- Automatically checks status when component mounts

### 2. API Endpoint for Enrollment Verification

**Created**: `app/api/enrollment/check/route.ts`
- POST endpoint that accepts `userId` and `courseId`
- Returns current enrollment status from Sanity
- Handles errors gracefully

### 3. Enhanced EnrollButton Component

**Updated**: `components/EnrollButton.tsx`
- Uses both server-side and client-side enrollment status
- Detects payment success in URL parameters
- Automatically refetches enrollment status after successful payment
- Includes manual refresh button for debugging
- Shows loading states during status checks

### 4. Payment Success URL Parameters

**Updated**: Both payment actions to include success parameters
- IntaSend: `?payment=success&enrolled=true`
- Stripe: `?payment=success&enrolled=true`
- EnrollButton detects these parameters and refetches status

## 🔄 How the Fix Works

### Payment Flow (Before Fix)
1. User clicks "Enroll Now"
2. Payment completed successfully
3. User redirected back to course page
4. **❌ Button still shows "Enroll Now" (stale data)**

### Payment Flow (After Fix)
1. User clicks "Enroll with M-Pesa"
2. Payment completed successfully
3. User redirected to: `/courses/course-slug?payment=success&enrolled=true`
4. **✅ EnrollButton detects `payment=success` parameter**
5. **✅ Automatically calls `refetch()` to check enrollment status**
6. **✅ API call to `/api/enrollment/check` verifies enrollment**
7. **✅ Button updates to "Access Course"**

## 🕐 Webhook Timing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Webhook Processes First (Ideal)
- Webhook creates enrollment immediately
- User returns to page
- Status check finds enrollment
- Button updates to "Access Course"

### Scenario 2: User Returns First (Common)
- User returns before webhook processes
- Initial status check doesn't find enrollment
- Automatic retry after 1 second delay
- Button updates once webhook completes

### Scenario 3: Webhook Fails (Edge Case)
- Webhook fails to process
- User can manually click "Refresh Status" button
- Manual intervention resolves the issue

## 🎯 Key Features of the Fix

### 1. **Automatic Detection**
```typescript
// Detects payment success in URL
const paymentStatus = searchParams.get('payment');
if (paymentStatus === 'success') {
  refetch(); // Automatically check enrollment status
}
```

### 2. **Dual Status Checking**
```typescript
// Uses both server and client enrollment status
const isEnrolled = clientIsEnrolled || initialIsEnrolled;
```

### 3. **Manual Refresh Option**
```typescript
// Refresh button for debugging/manual intervention
<button onClick={refetch}>
  <RefreshCw className="w-3 h-3" />
  Refresh Status
</button>
```

### 4. **Loading States**
```typescript
// Shows loading during status checks
if (!isUserLoaded || isPending || enrollmentLoading) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />;
}
```

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Automated Tests
```bash
npm run test:enrollment  # Test enrollment status logic
```

### Manual Testing
1. **Start development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Create test course** in Sanity CMS
3. **Complete payment flow** (IntaSend or Stripe)
4. **Verify button updates** to "Access Course"
5. **Test manual refresh** if needed

### Test Scenarios
- ✅ Successful IntaSend payment
- ✅ Successful Stripe payment
- ✅ Failed payment (button remains unchanged)
- ✅ Webhook timing delays
- ✅ Manual status refresh

## 📊 Expected Behavior

| Scenario | Before Fix | After Fix |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Successful Payment** | Button stays "Enroll Now" | Button becomes "Access Course" |
| **Failed Payment** | Button stays "Enroll Now" | Button stays "Enroll Now" |
| **Webhook Delay** | No retry mechanism | Automatic retry + manual option |
| **Page Refresh** | Server-side status only | Client-side verification |

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check Enrollment Status
1. Look for "Refresh Status" button (appears when enrolled)
2. Check browser console for API calls
3. Verify webhook logs in server console
4. Check Sanity CMS for enrollment records

### Common Issues
- **Webhook not processing**: Check IntaSend dashboard
- **API errors**: Check server logs
- **Timing issues**: Use manual refresh button
- **Environment variables**: Verify webhook challenge

## 🚀 Production Considerations

### Performance
- Client-side status checking adds minimal overhead
- API endpoint is lightweight and fast
- Automatic retries prevent unnecessary manual intervention

### User Experience
- Seamless transition from payment to course access
- Clear visual feedback during status checks
- Manual refresh option for edge cases
- Consistent behavior across payment methods

### Monitoring
- Monitor API endpoint performance
- Track enrollment status check success rates
- Log webhook processing times
- Alert on enrollment creation failures

## 📝 Files Modified

### New Files
- `hooks/useEnrollmentStatus.ts` - Client-side enrollment checking
- `app/api/enrollment/check/route.ts` - Enrollment verification API
- `docs/tests/test-enrollment-status.ts` - Test suite

### Modified Files
- `components/EnrollButton.tsx` - Enhanced with client-side checking
